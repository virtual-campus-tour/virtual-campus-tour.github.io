## Overview

The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) has undergraduate and graduate degree programs. There are over 13,000 students who apply to attend the university each year, composed of students who are based on Oahu - where the university is located - along with outer island residents and mainland/international students. These students want to determine whether UHM is the best fit for their college experience and the way they do that is by visiting the campus in-person.

As of Fall 2022, UHM only has a YouTube video and a third party service that highlights buildings on campus that acts as the virtual campus tour. Since Hawaii is located far away from most other major colleges, prospective students have to make a choice to either visit locally situated colleges, or fly out to UHM to take an in-person tour of our campus. Thus, it would benefit UHM to create a virtual campus tour that provides more information about the college experience at UHM.

As a team we decided that we wanted to wanted to make this tour based on the idea of it being 'for students by students.'

### Mock-Up Page Ideas (Long Term)

In our application we will be having a landing page, it will look similar to STAR GPS where there will be a “Start Virtual Tour” button along with log-in information so people can fitter what they may be interested in learning about UHM. After creating an account, users will be able to see general information about the university along with major-specific or interest-specific information such as related clubs or ongoing research projects and save anything that peaks their interest to go back to.

To individualize each user’s experience, there will be an “Interests” page where information will be presented according to the user's selected interests. For example, if a student is interested in Japanese, they can find out about the different Japanese classes, clubs, and study-abroad opportunities. Another example would be a computer science interest where students can learn about different clubs like ACM and Grey Hats, popular spots like ICSpace, and other computer science opportunities offered at UHM. These interests can be saved by each individual user to create a unique profile of what they want to learn about the UH campus. In addition to major-specific interests, there will also be general information such as places to eat, dorming, libraries/study spaces, and social areas (Warrior Recreation Center, Campus Center, etc).

### Mock Up Ideas (Current Project)

In this project for the course ICS 314: Software engineering where we have about 6 weeks to build an application, we based our pages on the Computer Science department and in the future we plan to branch out to other programs in the College of Natural Sciences and the other colleges that make up the University of Hawaii campus.

For being based on the computer science department, we decided to make the selection based on clubs and to save peoples interest in the club.

### Case Ideas (Long Term)
* User either logs in or takes a general virtual tour of the campus
* If they take a virtual tour, at the end, the user is prompted to select different interests and create a profile (optional)
* If the user logs in, they are taken to a my interests page in which they can add or remove interests
* Admin: Department admins can login and update information about their department’s related interests

### Case Ideas (Current Project)
* There is a user who can take the tour and visit all the webpages
* If the user logs in/ sign ups for an account, they are able to select the clubs they are interested in and save them. 
* If the person has an administrative role, they can add clubs or edit clubs based on the current information. 

### Beyond the Basics (Long Term)

There will also be a system for students to request in-person tours along with a feature to see other information that may be of interest to them such as nearby beaches, accommodations, financial information, scholarships and other student life opportunities. Something else that we would try implementing would be having a tour for current students so they are able to know how to get to their classes (eg. classroom HL 3F). 

## Beyond the Basics (Current Project)

On each page there are links to the respected pages of the different websites that UHM has such as the different eateries on campus and links to the dorming halls. Therefore, it helps to consolidate all the information for incoming students.

## User Guide

Upon visiting the site, the user is presented at the top level with a place to start their tour

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/landing.png">

To start the tour an individual would press the start virtual tour button. This then will take the individual to the general page. 

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/general-page.png">

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/dorming-2.png">

Following the general page, upon pressing the next button, this will take the user to a dining page that has all the eateries on campus.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/dining-1.png">

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/dining-2.png">

Upon pressing the next button, the user will then go to the classroom page, where the user can see the different environments that UH has to offer.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/classrooms.png">

Following the classroom page, then the campus center a focal point of campus is then able to be viewed.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/campuscenter.png">

Then following the campus center, it leads to the warrior recreation center where individuals are able to excercise.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/warriorrec.png">

Next, the user can see the study spaces that UHM has to offer such as the indoor and outdoor spaces open to students. 

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/studyspaces-1.png">

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/studyspaces-2.png">

Upon seeing the study spaces, the user proceeds to see the athletics that UHM has to offer. 

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/athletics-1.png">

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/athletics-2.png">

Then the user can see the computer science department page and can see the current research and clubs available to computer science majors.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/department.png">

Then the user can see the Pacific Ocean Science and Technology (POST) Building. This building was chosen, since it houses majority of the computer science faculty and the space for computer science majors. 

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/POST-building.png">

Then  upon viewing the building, it talks about the freshman requirements.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/admission.png">

Then for the last page of the tour, there are scholarships that UHM offers to its students. 

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/scholarships.png">

Finally, upon finishing viewing scholarships it takes the user to the finish tour page where they are able to learn more about the UHM campus.

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/endoftour.png">

All tha pages in the tour are either directly accessible in the nav bar or in the footer.

When the user logs in, they will have access to a my interest page that will be determined by the clubs that they choose interest them. 

<img width="400px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/myinterest.png">

## Development History 

The deployed project can be viewed at our [Virtual Campus Tours website link](https://uh-virtual-campus-tour.xyz/)

The development process was based on the Issue Driven Project Management practices for our Virtual Campus Tour 

### Issue Driven Project Management 

Issue Driven management is based on breaking the overall goal into subproblems to be accomplished within shorter time periods. As a team we value collaboration so to ensure we create the best quality project although there were tasks specified, we always seek constructive feedback.

In specifics, the Issue Driven Project Management can be notes as followed: 

* There are several sequences of milestones
* Each Milestone has a set of tasks that are described as GitHub Issues, and is assigned to a single developer to complete. ( However, in our approach we value communication so although one person is assigned the tasks we all contribute to providing feedback before the issue is closed) 
* Tasks consists of work that can be completed in 2-4 days. 
* The work for each task is accomplished within a git branch named with "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue 
*  When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged to master upon review 
*  The state of each tasks such as todo, in progress, done is managed by the GitHub Project Board.
