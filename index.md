## Overview

The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) has undergraduate and graduate degree programs. There are over 13,000 students who apply to attend the university each year, composed of students who are based on Oahu - where the university is located - along with outer island residents and mainland/international students. These students want to determine whether UHM is the best fit for their college experience and the way they do that is by visiting the campus in-person.

As of Fall 2022, UHM only has a YouTube video that acts as the virtual campus tour. Since Hawaii is located far away from most other major colleges, prospective students have to make a choice to either visit locally situated colleges, or fly out to UHM to take an in-person tour of our campus. Thus, it would benefit UHM to create a virtual campus tour.

### Mock-Up Page Ideas

In our application we will be having a landing page, it will look similar to STAR GPS where there will be a “Start New Experience” button along with log-in information so people can fitter what they may be interested in learning about UHM. After creating an account, users will be able to see general information about the university along with major-specific or interest-specific information such as related clubs or ongoing research projects.

To individualize each user’s experience, there will be an “Interests” page where information will be presented according to the user's selected interests. For example, if a student is interested in Japanese, they can find out about the different Japanese classes, clubs, and study-abroad opportunities. Another example would be a computer science interest where students can learn about different clubs like ACM and Grey Hats, popular spots like ICSpace, and other computer science opportunities offered at UHM. These interests can be saved by each individual user to create a unique profile of what they want to learn about the UH campus. In addition to major-specific interests, there will also be general information such as places to eat, dorming, libraries/study spaces, and social areas (Warrior Recreation Center, Campus Center, etc).

In this project, we are currently planning to make pages for the Computer Science department and in the future we plan to branch out to other programs in the College of Natural Sciences and the other colleges that make up the University of Hawaii campus.

### Case Ideas
* User either logs in or takes a general virtual tour of the campus
* If they take a virtual tour, at the end, the user is prompted to select different interests and create a profile (optional)
* If the user logs in, they are taken to a my interests page in which they can add or remove interests
* Admin: Department admins can login and update information about their department’s related interests

### Beyond the Basics

There will also be a system for students to request in-person tours along with a feature to see other information that may be of interest to them such as nearby beaches, accommodations, financial information, scholarships and other student life opportunities. Something else that we would try implementing would be having a tour for current students so they are able to know how to get to their classes (eg. classroom HL 3F).

## Development History 

The deployed project can be viewed at our [Virtual Campus Tours website link](http://146.190.36.48)

The development process was based on the Issue Driven Project Management practices for our Virtual Campus Tour 

### Issue Driven Project Management 

Issue Driven management is based on breaking the overall goal into subproblems to be accomplished within shorter time periods. As a team we value collaboration so to ensure we create the best quality project although there were tasks specified, we always seek constructive feedback.

In specifics, the Issue Driven Project Management can be notes as followed: 

* There are several sequences of milestones
* Each Milestone has a set of tasks that are described as GitHub Issues, and is assigned to a single developer to complete. ( However, in our approach we value communication so although one person is assigned the tasks we all contribute to providing feedback before the issue is closed) 
* Tasks consists of work that can be completed in 2-4 days. 
* The work for each task is accomplished within a git branch named with "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue 
*  When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged to master upon review 
*  The state of each tasks such as todo, in progress, done is managed by the GitHub Project Board.


### Milestone 1: Mockup development

To manage our Milestone we had used GitHub projects. [Attached is our Milestone 1 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/virtual-campus-tour/projects/1/views/1)

In this milestone there were 2 goals:
(1) To create a landing page
(2) Create a landing page and start to gather information for later tasks

For our first goal we were able to create a landing page with a footer and navbar that we had also made mock-ups for.

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/landing-page-coded.png">

We also had generated three other pages: 

The login page:

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/login.png">

The Sign up page:

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/sign-up.png">

The sign out page
<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/sign-out.png">

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create mockup of pages for the system. Along with gathering of information so we are able to be prepared for future tasks.

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/LandingPage.png"> 

When the user lands on this page, they will be prompted to explore the University of Hawaii at Manoa through a general overall tour, along with the option to explore their interest specifically.

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/Exploring-Interests.png"> 

At the end of the general tour, there will be an explore interest page when they can explore departments and clubs that exist at the University of Hawaii. 

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/Exploring-Specific-Major.png"> 

When choosing the major an individual may be interested in, they will be showed some research that is ongoing by the professors in the department along with the clubs that are considering to pretain to the department. 

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/Optionally-Looking-At-Things.png"> 

If someone does not want to go through the whole tour they will have the option to look at specific parts they are interested in at the University.

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/post-building-example.png"> 

For each building there will be a page to describe what departments/ types of classes are hosted in each building. Above is an example for the Pacific Ocean Science Technology (POST) Building.

<img width="700px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../images-mockup/Footer.png"> 

At the bottom of each page there will be a footer for a person to look at specific pages, apply to the University and Book an in-person tour

### Milestone 2: Create Functionality

To manage our Milestone we continued to use GitHub projects. [Our Milestone 2 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/virtual-campus-tour/projects/2)

Additional MockUps completed:

First page of tour:
