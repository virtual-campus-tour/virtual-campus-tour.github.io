## Overview

The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) has undergraduate and graduate degree programs. There are over 13,000 students who apply to attend the university each year, composed of students who are based on Oahu - where the university is located - along with outer island residents and mainland/international students. These students want to determine whether UHM is the best fit for their college experience and the way they do that is by visiting the campus in-person.

As of Fall 2022, UHM only has a YouTube video that acts as the virtual campus tour. Since Hawaii is located far away from most other major colleges, prospective students have to make a choice to either visit locally situated colleges, or fly out to UHM to take an in-person tour of our campus. Thus, it would benefit UHM to create a virtual campus tour.

###### Mock-Up Page Ideas

In our application we will be having a landing page, it will look similar to STAR GPS where there will be a “Start New Experience” button along with log-in information so people can fitter what they may be interested in learning about UHM. After creating an account, users will be able to see general information about the university along with major-specific or interest-specific information such as related clubs or ongoing research projects.

To individualize each user’s experience, there will be an “Interests” page where information will be presented according to the user's selected interests. For example, if a student is interested in Japanese, they can find out about the different Japanese classes, clubs, and study-abroad opportunities. Another example would be a computer science interest where students can learn about different clubs like ACM and Grey Hats, popular spots like ICSpace, and other computer science opportunities offered at UHM. These interests can be saved by each individual user to create a unique profile of what they want to learn about the UH campus. In addition to major-specific interests, there will also be general information such as places to eat, dorming, libraries/study spaces, and social areas (Warrior Recreation Center, Campus Center, etc).

In this project, we are currently planning to make pages for the Computer Science department and in the future we plan to branch out to other programs in the College of Natural Sciences and the other colleges that make up the University of Hawaii campus.

###### Case Ideas
* User either logs in or takes a general virtual tour of the campus
* If they take a virtual tour, at the end, the user is prompted to select different interests and create a profile (optional)
* If the user logs in, they are taken to a my interests page in which they can add or remove interests
* Admin: Department admins can login and update information about their department’s related interests

###### Beyond the Basics

There will also be a system for students to request in-person tours along with a feature to see other information that may be of interest to them such as nearby beaches, accommodations, financial information, scholarships and other student life opportunities. Something else that we would try implementing would be having a tour for current students so they are able to know how to get to their classes (eg. classroom HL 3F).
